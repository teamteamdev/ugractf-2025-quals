Blocks were rendered from textures with Blockbench using the "Isometric Right" projection. The author does not believe this adds enough originality to warrant a copyright, but if you want to play safe, the author hereby formally releases the work under CC BY-SA 4.0, licensed to Alisa Sireneva.

The textures "Pigstep" and "Tripwire Hook" are own work and are hereby released under CC0.

The texture "Dragon Egg" is a recolored texture of the Pixel Perfection "Dragon Egg" texture, masked by the "Egg" texture of the same texture pack. As such, it is hereby released under CC BY-SA 4.0, licensed to Alisa Sireneva.
